These are my solutions to the function challenges put forth during the section Fun with Functions. The answers are given in the slides, however, there was no simple way to test your solutions. My answers differ in that I used ES2015 implementations and eschewed binary functions to allow unlimited arguments to be passed into the function.

### Commands
- `yarn run test` - runs tests once
- `yarn run test:watch` - runs tests and watches for changes
- `yarn run eslint` - runs eslint on code

### Libraries
Jest - setup test cases to run and watch  
Nodemon - run code outside of test runner
